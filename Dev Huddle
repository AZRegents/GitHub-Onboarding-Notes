## Onboarding Items

### GitHub Repository Setup
- Create a repository per app or project.
- Reviewed GitHub UI or terminal for commits.

- **Important**: Avoid saving repos in OneDrive (causes sync conflicts).
  - Recommended path: `C:\Users\YourName\GitHub`  or C:\Users\YourName\Source 

### Transferring Repositories
- Use `Settings > Transfer` in GitHub to move repos from personal to org.
- GitHub now requires **token-based or SSH authentication**—no username/password login.

### GitHub Notifications in Microsoft Teams
- Set up GitHub → ABOR Teams  → GitHub Channel integration to update team on repo activity.
- TO-DO Add setup instructions in the onboarding repo.

### VS Code Workspace Tips
- Use Workspaces and Save Workspace As.
- Keep `.code-workspace` folder **outside** repo, next to repo folder.

### Power Platform Snippets Repository
- Creating separate markdown files or sections for:
  - Power Apps
  - Power Automate
  - SharePoint

###  Recommended VS Code Extensions
- **Power Platform Tools**
- **SQL Server Integration**
- **C# Dev Kit** (for legacy apps)
- Document extensions in onboarding notes.


### Transfer repo from one Org (or personal) into another Org
- Go to the repository you want to transfer.  
- **Settings**.  
- Go down to the **Danger Zone** section.  
- **"Transfer"** next to **"Transfer ownership"**.  
- Enter the **target organization name**.  
- Confirm by typing **repository name**.
